## Project Description

This C project, "0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops," is part of the curriculum and was authored by Julien Barbier. The project focuses on expanding your knowledge of C programming by introducing concepts such as nested loops and functions. It aims to deepen your understanding of functions, prototypes, header files, and the use of nested loops for solving various programming challenges.

**Project Timeline:**
- Project Start Date: Aug 17, 2023, 6:00 AM
- Project End Date: Aug 18, 2023, 6:00 AM
- Auto QA Review: 41.6/70 mandatory & 12.35/19 optional
- Overall Score: 98.06%

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

#### General

- Understand the concept of nested loops and how to use them effectively.
- Learn what a function is and how to define and use functions in C.
- Distinguish between the declaration and definition of a function.
- Comprehend the purpose of function prototypes.
- Explore the scope of variables in C.
- Familiarize yourself with GCC flags such as -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, -std=gnu89.
- Learn how to use header files with `#include` to modularize your code.

### Copyright - Plagiarism

Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden. You are responsible for creating your solutions for the project tasks and should not copy or publish someone else's work.

## Requirements

#### General

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Line Endings: All your files should end with a new line.
- README.md: A README.md file at the root of the project folder, describing the purpose of each script.
- Code Style: Your code should adhere to the Betty style, and it will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Global Variables: You are not allowed to use global variables.
- Function Limit: No more than 5 functions per file.
- Standard Library Functions: You are not allowed to use standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
- Custom _putchar Function: You are allowed to use _putchar. You don't have to push _putchar.c; we will use our file. If you do, it won't be taken into account.
- Main.c Files: The main.c files shown in the examples are provided for testing your functions but don't need to be pushed to your repository. We will use our own main.c files for compilation.
- Header File: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h. Don't forget to push your header file.

## File Descriptions

In this section, provide a brief description of each script or file included in your project. You can use this section to explain the purpose of each function or module and how they contribute to achieving the project's learning objectives.

## Usage

In this section, provide examples or instructions on how to use your functions or scripts. Explain the expected inputs and outputs, and demonstrate their usage if necessary.
