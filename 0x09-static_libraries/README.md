## Concepts

For this project, you are expected to explore the concept of C static libraries. Here are some resources and concepts to get you started:

### Resources

- [Creating A Static “C” Library Using “ar” and “ranlib”](https://www.learnc.org/help/cs50/problems/static-library/creating-a-static-c-library-using-ar-and-ranlib)
- [Using A “C” Library In A Program](https://www.learnc.org/help/cs50/problems/static-library/using-a-c-library-in-a-program)
- [What is the difference between Dynamic and Static library (Static and Dynamic linking) (stop at 4:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RPtJ9UyHS0) (Video)

Man or Help:

- `ar`
- `ranlib`
- `nm`

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General

- What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it.
- Basic usage of `ar`, `ranlib`, `nm`.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Please note that you are expected to come up with solutions for the project tasks independently to meet the learning objectives. Plagiarism and copying someone else's work are strictly forbidden and can result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### C

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Newline:** All your files should end with a newline character.
- **README.md:** A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- **Coding Style:** Your code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables:** You are not allowed to use global variables.
- **Functions per File:** No more than 5 functions per file.
- **Standard Library:** You are not allowed to use the standard library. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., are forbidden.

@alxFosterSetor
You do not need to learn about dynamic libraries for this project. Focus on understanding and working with static libraries.
