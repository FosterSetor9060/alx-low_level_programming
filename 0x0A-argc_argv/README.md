## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General

- How to use arguments passed to your program.
- Understanding the two prototypes of the `main` function and when to use each.
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Please note that you are responsible for developing solutions for the project tasks independently to meet the learning objectives. Plagiarism, copying someone else's work, or publishing any project content is strictly forbidden and can result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Newline:** All your files should end with a newline character.
- **README.md:** A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- **Coding Style:** Your code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables:** You are not allowed to use global variables.
- **Functions per File:** No more than 5 functions per file.
- **Header File:** The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`. Donâ€™t forget to push your header file.
- **Standard Library:** You are allowed to use the standard library.

Please follow these requirements carefully as you work on this project.
