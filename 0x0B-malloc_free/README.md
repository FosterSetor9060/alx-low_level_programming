## Project Description

This project is a part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. The goal is to understand automatic and dynamic memory allocation, the purpose and usage of `malloc` and `free`, as well as how to check for memory leaks using Valgrind.

### Project Details

## Concepts

For this project, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

- Automatic and dynamic allocation
- `malloc` and `free` functions

---

## Resources

To complete this project, you can refer to the following resources:

- [0x0a - malloc & free - quick overview.pdf](0x0a%20-%20malloc%20%26%20free%20-%20quick%20overview.pdf)
- [Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free (stop at 6:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDVC3wKjS64)
- `man` pages or `help` command for:
  - `malloc`
  - `free`

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

**General**
- The difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What `malloc` and `free` are and how to use them
- When and why to use `malloc`
- How to use Valgrind to check for memory leaks

---

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should adhere to the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., are forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`; it will be provided
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo. Holberton will use its own `main.c` files for compilation, which might be different from the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file named `main.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file

### More Info

- You do not have to learn about `calloc` and `realloc` for this project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Write your C functions according to the project requirements.
3. Compile your code using `gcc` with the provided flags.
4. Test your functions using your preferred method or the provided `main.c` files (if necessary).
5. Make sure your code passes the checker and satisfies the project requirements.
6. Push your code to your Git repository.
