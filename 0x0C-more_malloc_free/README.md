# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

## Project Description

This project focuses on memory allocation in the C programming language. It covers topics related to dynamic memory allocation using functions such as `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. The project aims to enhance your understanding of memory management and improve your C programming skills.

## Concepts

This project is designed to reinforce your knowledge of the following concepts:

- Automatic and dynamic allocation
- Usage of `malloc` and `free` functions

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, you may find the following resources helpful:

- **Read or Watch:** [Do I cast the result of malloc?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc)
- **Man Pages or Help:** `exit (3)`, `calloc`, `realloc`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

- How to use the `exit` function
- What the `calloc` and `realloc` functions are in the standard library and how to use them

## Copyright & Plagiarism

- You are expected to create your solutions for the project tasks independently.
- Copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work is strictly prohibited.
- You are not allowed to publish any content related to this project.
- Plagiarism is against the rules and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Global variables are not allowed
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- Do not push `_putchar.c`; it will not be taken into account
- Prototypes of all functions and the `_putchar` function should be included in a header file named `main.h`
- Remember to push your header file
