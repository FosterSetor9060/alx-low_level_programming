Here's a sample `README.md` file for your C project on Preprocessor:

---

# Project 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Description

This project is a part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on the C preprocessor. You will learn about macros, predefined macros, including header file guards, and other essential concepts related to preprocessing in C.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what macros are and how to use them in C programming.
- Familiarize yourself with common predefined macros.
- Learn how to include guard your header files to prevent multiple inclusions.
- Gain knowledge about the C program compilation process and the role of the preprocessor.

## Resources

- [Understanding C program Compilation Process](#)
- [Object-like Macros](#)
- [Macro Arguments](#)
- [Pre Processor Directives in C](#)
- [The C Preprocessor](#)
- [Standard Predefined Macros](#)
- [include guard](#)
- [Common Predefined Macros](#)
- Additional resources provided in the project instructions.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won't be taken into account.
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of various tasks, and you are required to create solutions for each of them to meet the learning objectives mentioned above. Avoid plagiarism, and make sure to create your own solutions.

## How to Use

You can compile and run the provided example `main.c` files to test your functions, but note that your main.c files may differ from the examples provided.

To compile a C file, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_file.c
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./my_program
```
