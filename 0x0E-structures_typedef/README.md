# Project 0x0E. C - Structures, Typedef

## Description

This project is a part of the Holberton School curriculum and aims to teach you about structures and `typedef` in C programming. You will learn what structures are, when and why to use them, and how to use `typedef`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what structures are and understand when and why to use them.
- Demonstrate how to use `typedef` to create custom data types.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of various tasks, and you are required to create solutions for each of them to meet the learning objectives mentioned above. Avoid plagiarism, and make sure to create your own solutions.

## How to Use

You can compile and run the provided example `main.c` files to test your functions, but note that your main.c files may differ from the examples provided.

To compile a C file, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_file.c
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./my_program
```
