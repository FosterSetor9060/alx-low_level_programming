# 0x10. C - Variadic Functions

## Project Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on understanding and implementing variadic functions in C. Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. In this project, we will learn how to work with variadic functions by using the `stdarg.h` library and the macros `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what variadic functions are.
- Understand and use the `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros for working with variadic functions.
- Know why and how to use the `const` type qualifier in C.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All code files should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Do not use global variables.
- Each C file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, and `realloc` are forbidden.
- You are allowed to use the macros `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
- Do not push `_putchar.c`; it will be provided separately.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in the header file called `variadic_functions.h`.
- Don't forget to include guards in all your header files.

## Tasks

You are required to complete the following tasks to meet the learning objectives:

1. Task 0: Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
2. Task 1: Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
3. Task 2: Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
4. Task 3: Write a function that prints anything.
5. Advanced Task: Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters of integer or float type.
