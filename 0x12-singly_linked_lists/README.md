### Concepts

For this project, you are expected to grasp the following concepts:

- Data Structures

### Resources

To prepare for this project, you can read or watch resources related to linked lists:

- [Linked Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

#### General

- When and why to use linked lists vs. arrays
- How to build and use linked lists

### Copyright - Plagiarism

Remember that you are responsible for creating your solutions for the project tasks to meet the learning objectives mentioned above. Plagiarism and copying others' work are strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

#### General

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
- Compilation Options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- File Line Endings: All your files should end with a new line
- Mandatory Files: README.md (this file)
- Code Style: Your code should use the Betty style and will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Global Variables: You are not allowed to use global variables
- Function Limit: No more than 5 functions per file
- C Standard Library Functions: The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., is forbidden.
- Custom _putchar Function: You are allowed to use _putchar. You don't have to push _putchar.c; we will use our file. If you do, it won't be taken into account.
- Examples: The main.c files in the examples are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo. We will use our own main.c files at compilation, which might be different from the ones shown in the examples.
- Header File: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h. Don't forget to push your header file.
- Header File Guard: All your header files should be include guarded.
