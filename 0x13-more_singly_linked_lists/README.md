## Description
This project, 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists, is a part of the C programming curriculum and focuses on deepening your understanding of linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Through this project, you will gain practical experience in working with singly linked lists and applying your knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to use linked lists
- Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

### Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked with coming up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the above learning objectives. Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`; we will use our file. If you do, it won't be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do, we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Usage
To work on this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create and edit the required C source files.
3. Compile your code using the provided compilation options.
4. Test your functions and program using the example `main.c` files.
5. Ensure your code passes the auto review and adheres to the specified requirements.
6. Push your changes to your Git repository.
7. Submit your project by the deadline.
