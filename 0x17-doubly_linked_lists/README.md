0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

verview
This repository contains solutions to problems related to doubly linked lists in the C programming language. The implementation of algorithms and data structures is focused on understanding and working with doubly linked lists efficiently.


Introduction
Doubly linked lists are a type of linked list where each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the next node in the sequence, and another pointing to the previous node. This repository includes various C programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists.
