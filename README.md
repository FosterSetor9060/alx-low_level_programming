# 0x08. C - Recursion

![C logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/C_Logo.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a powerful concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Through this project, you'll learn how to use recursion effectively, its implementation, and when it's appropriate to use or avoid it.

## Project Details

- **Author:** Julien Barbier
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** August 30, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** August 31, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** August 30, 2023, 6:00 AM
- An auto review will be launched at the deadline.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

### General

- Understand the concept of recursion in programming.
- Implement recursive functions.
- Identify scenarios where recursion is a suitable approach.
- Recognize situations where recursion should be avoided.

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, you should read or watch the following resources:

- [0x08. Recursion, introduction](#)
- [What on Earth is Recursion?](#)
- [C - Recursion](#)
- [C Programming Tutorial 85, Recursion pt.1](#)
- [C Programming Tutorial 86, Recursion pt.2](#)

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All code files should end with a newline character.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should adhere to the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Do not use global variables.
- Limit each file to a maximum of 5 functions.
- Do not use standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- You can use the `_putchar` function.
- Do not include `_putchar.c` as we will use our own file for it.
- Prototypes of all functions and the `_putchar` function should be included in a header file named `main.h`. Don't forget to push your header file.
- Avoid using any kind of loops.
- Do not use static variables.

## Plagiarism Warning

You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks independently. Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly prohibited. Publishing any content of this project is not allowed and will result in removal from the program.
